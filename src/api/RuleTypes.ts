/**
 * The `CombinedStyleset` type extends the Styleset type with certain properties that provide
 * additional meaning to the styleset and allow building dependent style rules:
 * - The `"+"` property specifies one or more parent style rules. This allows specifying
 *   parent rules using a convenient style-property-like notation.
 * - Properties with pseudo class names (e.g. `:hover`) or pseudo element names (e.g. `::after`).
 *   These properties define a styleset that will be assigned to the selector obtained by using
 *   the original styleset's owner followed by the given pseudo class or pseudo element.
 * - Properties with names of parameterized pseudo classes (e.g. `:nth-child`) or parameterized
 *   pseudo elements (e.g. `::slotted`). These properties contain a tuple, where the first
 *   element is the parameter for the selector and the second element is the styleset.
 *   These properties define a styleset that will be assigned to the selector obtained by using
 *   the original styleset's owner followed by the given pseudo class or pseudo element.
 * - Properties with the ampersand symbol (`&`) that contain arrays of two-element tuples each
 *   defining a selector and a style corresponding to this selector. Selectors can use the
 *   ampersand symbol to refer to the parent style selector. If the ampersand symbol is not used,
 *   the selector will be simply appended to the parent selector.
 *
 * Functions that return style rules (e.g. [[$class]]) accept the `CombinedStyleset` as a parameter,
 * for example:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * class MyStyles extends css.StyleDefinition
 * {
 *     class1 = css.$class({})
 *     class2 = css.$class({
 *         backgroundColor: "white",
 *         ":hover" : { backgroundColor: "grey" },
 *         "&": [
 *             [ "li > &", { backgroundColor: "yellow" } ],
 *             [ this.class1, { backgroundColor: "orange" } ]
 *         ]
 *     })
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This will translate to the following CSS (in reality, class names are auto-generated):
 *
 * ```css
 * .class2 { backgroundColor: white; }
 * .class2:hover { backgroundColor: grey; }
 * li > .class2 { backgroundColor: yellow; }
 * .class2.class1 { backgroundColor: orange; }
 * ```
